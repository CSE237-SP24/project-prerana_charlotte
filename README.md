# base-project

For Iteration 1, we completed the following user stories:
1. The user can withdraw money from the bank account
2. The user can check the balance of the bank account
3. The user can deposit money into the bank account
4. The user can make a new bank account

For our next iteration, we plan on adding more functionality to the Bank class, such as creating a debit card and being able to conduct things on the account from Bank.

To Run Script: ./script.sh
